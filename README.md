- Problem-1.py: Created a simple calculator using class.
- Problem-2.py: Logic is printing as many odd numbers as the input value. Used join to display output in a clean and professional format. Since, join works only with strings, used map(str, result) to convert the result into strings.
- Problem-3.py: Logic is printing all odd numbers till input value if the input value is an odd number and till input-1 if input is an even number.
